Currently deployed on Heroku: URL

Sticker Tracker is a fullstack web application designed to use in tandem with the popular Panini FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Sticker Album, with the purpose of adding the physical stickers you collect to your digital album so you can have quick and easy access to see what stickers you already have and most importantly, what stickers you are still missing. To make trading as easy as possible, with the click of a button you can pull up the list of missing stickers and use that to share with anyone you want.
